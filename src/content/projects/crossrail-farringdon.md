## Lead Structures Engineer

- Designer and technical support. I was mainly responsible for the low-level design of various steel structures and elements across the entire station (i.e. CAT ladders, Fall-arrest systems, platforms, fixing testing etc.). The design often required non-standard approach and deviation from the Standards which led to frequent site visits, advance FEM modelling and site testing. I was also participating in Design meetings with the Main Contractor and sub-contractors, which also included joined workshops and site walks.

- Farringdon, Steel Fabricators support. I was responsible to review the detail design and to coordinated between the Principal Designer (Atkins) and the sub-contractors (Steel Fabricators). I was travelling to the sub-contractorâ€™s offices twice a week to provide guidance and preliminary comments that improved the design and accelerated the submission process.d concrete, development of Revit model and production of concrete detailing and BBS.
